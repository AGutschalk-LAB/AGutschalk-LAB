## Welcome to the Auditory Cognition Lab

### About Us
The Auditory Cognition Lab is dedicated to unraveling the complexities of how we perceive and process auditory information. Our interdisciplinary team aims to identify neural correlates of auditory perception and cognition by combining various functional imaging techniques (EEG, MEG, and fMRI), studies in patients with cortical lesions after stroke, and, most recently, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques.

### Meet the Team
